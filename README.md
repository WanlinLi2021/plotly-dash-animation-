# Plotly/Dash display cases of SARS-COV-2 in smooth animation

Plotly Dash is a Python framework for building web-based data visualization applications. The "animation" feature in Plotly Dash allows for creating interactive visualizations, such as graphs and charts with moving elements. This feature utilizes the Plotly JavaScript library to create dynamic and responsive animations that can be easily integrated into web applications.

Thanks to Plotly, we created an animation dashboard to show confirmed cases of SARS-COV-2 in different regions of Quebec.
